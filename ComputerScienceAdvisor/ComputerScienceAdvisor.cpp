/*
The name of the program is The Computer Science Advisor.  
It will be an innovative, evolving C++ console artificial intelligence application.  
Its job is to receive input of a student id and load in that student’s information such as classes taken, classes they need to take, the time of currently available classes, 
the instructors teaching those classes, and finally the student’s preference that were discovered via previous runnings of the application and make a smart class schedule.  
This smart class schedule will be based on the preferences of the student whose id was inputted in due to past runnings such as time, teachers, and classes, 
assuming the class is not required to graduate.  It will also only suggest classes that are open and then if there are not enough open classes fill in classes that are waitlist.
